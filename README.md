# ML-GVE
ML-GVE is an XGBoost-based model for predicting pathogenicity of variants in exons and introns. It was originally designed for the [Sherloc challenge](https://genomeinterpretation.org/cagi6-invitae.html) in the 6th Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation. The model is one of the two best-performing models in the Sherloc challenge, ranking the first for overall and indel prediction. This repository extended the original implementation ([chenkenbio/CAGI6-Sherloc-model](https://github.com/chenkenbio/CAGI6-Sherloc-model)) and provided scripts for additional analysis and experiments.
