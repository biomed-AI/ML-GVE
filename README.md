# ML-GVE
The ML-GVE was developed as a machine learning model to predict the pathogenicity of variants in both coding and non-coding regions, specifically designed for the 6th Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI6-Sherloc) competition. It achieved outstanding performance in the competition and was considered one of the top-performing models. The program was adapted from the chenkenbio/CAGI6-Sherloc-model repository (https://github.com/chenkenbio/CAGI6-Sherloc-model.git).
