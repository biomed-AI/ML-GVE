# ML-GVE
The ML-GVE was a machine learning model for predicting the pathogenicity of variants in both coding and non-coding regions. It was designed for the 6-th Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI6-Sherloc) competition. And it was one of the best performance models in the competition. The program was modified based on the chenkenbio/CAGI6-Sherloc-model(https://github.com/chenkenbio/CAGI6-Sherloc-model.git).
